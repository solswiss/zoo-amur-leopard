At least 624 were killed between 1910 and 1945 during Japanese Rule. The last known South Korean leopard was captured in 1970.</div> <div class="svelte-g5savc">In Russia, the leopard's native range has <span class="important svelte-g5savc">decreased by 80%</span>.

Not only do the poachers hunt the Amur leopard for their spotted fur, but important prey species as well.</div> <div class="svelte-g5savc">This creates a problem known as <span class="important svelte-g5savc">prey scarcity</span>; as a result of excessive poaching and hunting, the prey base in otherwise habitable areas cannot sustain large populations of leopards and similar predators.</div> <div class="svelte-g5savc">The underlying problem is <span class="important svelte-g5savc">illegal wildlife trade</span>. Amur leopards have historically been poached nearly to the point of no return.

The leopards can only return to their home along the Russia-China border when there are habitats that can sustain the leopard populations.</div> <div class="svelte-g5savc">Conservation efforts include Land of the Leopard National Park in Russia, anti-poaching initiatives in their habitat, programs to stop the illegal trade in leopard parts, limits on poaching of prey species, and reintroduction of prey species to rebuild prey populations.</div> <div class="svelte-g5savc">Do you want to be a part of this journey?
